Karate Club Modularity Graph.

Core focus to:
- Implement recursive spectral modularity partitioning to detect multiple communities in the Karate Club graph.
- Visualize the graph after each split with different colors for communities.
- Compute node metrics (degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, clustering).
- Plot how these metrics evolve across iterations.
- Write a short discussion about which nodes remain central and how community structure influences metrics.
